#Code Louisville Front End Project                                     
##March 2017

This website is meant to showcase my basic front end web development skills. The content is fake and not meant to be taken seriously. It can be viewed in any modern browser, and it's designed to be responsive to your viewing device.
I hope you like the site, the main character is my 11 year old niece. Another goal I had in building this site is to introduce some of my family, to the possibilities of web development. My niece helped me with the photos and video selection. Isaac Bowman
