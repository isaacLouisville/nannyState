This website is meant to showcase my basic frontend web development skills. The content is fake and not meant to be taken seriously. It can be viewed in any modern browser, and it's designed to be responsive to your viewing device.
I hope you like the site, the main character is my 11 year old niece. Another goal I had in building this site is to introduce some of my family, to the possibilities of web development. My niece helped me with the color scheme and font selection. isaac
